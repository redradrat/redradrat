I always kept with the idea of having my resume public.
This is not yet synced with my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/ralphkuehnert). So in case of any doubt, LinkedIn is the more current version. 

## Head of Software Engineering
**Angelbird Technologies, Austria**  
*Nov 2023 - Jul 2024*

> Angelbird Technologies, as a hardware-focussed company, was an entirely new experience for me. I have spent the majority of my previous career within environments where software products were already established as company strategy. Providing the necessary perspective and focusing on sustainable, modern software engineering within a non-software centric environment was a huge eye-opener and a great time for learning. 
> 
> Although for personal reasons, I had to leave this role earlier than I would have wished for, I'm grateful for having met some incredibly nice and committed people.

> At Hilti the opportunity arose, to design and lead development of a new cloud-native and multi-purpose infrastructure platform to serve as a foundation for various projects around the globe. I took the opportunity, moving from the start-up sphere into the corporate world, with Hilti not only just being a technical innovator, but also a global front-runner in its various business areas.

## Developer / Consultant
**Loodse, Germany**  
*Nov 2018 - Apr 2019*

> Loodse, with their own range of kubernetes-focused tech, is not only one an active player in the global kubernetes ecosystem, but also an innovation driver. Working here, I learned a lot about what it means to work on the frontier of modern infrastructure design and how to learn and adapt quickly, but also how to facilitate implementation and design for environments traditionally not used to fast-paced iteration.

I spent some wonderfully rich and insightful years here, acquiring and honing skills and a well-rounded view on software architecture and abstraction design. Initially starting to work on test automation, my role quickly shifted towards engineering infrastructure automation solutions for the platform and implementing DevOps componentry for the development, test and deployment workflows. 
>
> The move to the Cloud for the platform, as a scalable service to build solutions of any size and networking requirements, required me to build up a deep understanding of modern infrastructure architecture and operations and a strong skillset to develop such. Working in a start-up really is the greatest learning experience, from business to tech skills. Nothing is more unforgiving than the deep endâ€¦

Tricentis was a great employer, that grew a lot since then - awesome to see!
